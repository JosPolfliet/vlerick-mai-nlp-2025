In past years the headcount of BDs has gone down due to restructurings and not filling vacancies on time + hiring freezes. Turnover peaked at 24,6% in 2017.\\n\\nVoluntary BD turnover is higher than total workforce • Voluntary BD turnover is steady, around 12-13% • Starting 2016, a new BD profile has been implemented with an effect on involuntary turnover (and indirectly on voluntary turnover).\\n\\nThe overall forecast for 2018 is looking good:\\n\\nTurnover rate expected to remain below the BP of 18,5%.\\n\\nActions taken/planned to reduce turnover in area of onboarding, rewards & recognition, learning & development and career opportunities.\\n\\nRestructuring & changed HR policies in area of incentives, recognition and reward, training & development start to show an effect?\\n\\nKey perceived causes for turnover\\n\\nKey perceived causes for turnover\\n\\nAggressive new players entering in the Swiss\\n\\nHigh complexity in the job of BD’s due to new products\\n\\nGastronomy market providing new job opportunities • High attractiveness of our BD compared to competitors\\n\\ndue to high continuous education level\\n\\nCustomer structure complexity (multichannel customer approach)\\n\\nCareer outlook within the organization\\n\\nand administrative burden\\n\\nFixed salary unaligned with market compared to job responsibilities. • Work-life balance • Our employees are attractive for other big companies as we are seen as ‘the best business school in FMCG for BD segment’\\n\\nTURNOVER POLAND\\n\\nTurnover Trend\\n\\nTurnover of BD’s equaled double of general workforce last years, with voluntary turnover playing a big part.

Results are reported on an aggregated level. On top of that, by exploiting the model we are able to detect the risk drivers which in turn lead to actionable insights.\\n\\nTrain\\n\\nTest & Validate\\n\\nPredict\\n\\nLasso for feature selection\\n\\nRandom Forest for prediction\\n\\nClustering based on proximity matrix RF\\n\\nWe validate our model by comparing actual resignation with predicted resignation on a test dataset (data not seen by the model).

Junior BD’s are severely at risk in first years of tenure: 35-40% of BD’s under 25 leave the organization within their first 2 years.\\n\\n2. Different actions to prevent BD turnover have been identified in qualitative deep dives with HR BP’s & sales managers. Most important actions are on the topic of onboarding & recruitment for junior BD’s and a repositioning of performance improvement plans.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIn future analyses, it is important to consider the connectedness of retention and performance.

Data To create an analysis template, we depart from desk research based on scientific literature, previous work at clients and expert knowledge on the client side. We list all potential data points that should be taken into account in the analyses that are available in the organization.\\n\\n2. Analysis protocol Based on the data and further information on complexities that may arise, we define a formal protocol of the analytical steps. To restrict the subjectivity, the protocol formalizes some details on data to be used, transformations that are required, models to explore, but also when effects are considered relevant – for which we recommend aligning upfront.\\n\\n3. Statistical analyses We conduct the analyses by the guidelines of the protocol that we define a priori. Typical steps of the modelling process include data transformations, fitting a statistical model to test importance of factors influencing pay and post-analysis checks, diagnostics and remedial measures.\\n\\n4. Regression analyses Regression analyses is a technique that is often used for such use cases. The aim of regression analysis is to decompose to what extent some characteristics (i.e. gender, age, function, …) contribute to the variable of interest: pay gap. Analyzing gender pay equity roughly translates to examining the presence of an effect for gender in a robust statistical model.\\n\\n5. Meaning of the numbers Given a finalized model, we report on how pay is influenced by the characteristics and how gender plays a role. We provide model summaries (for instance, metrics such as R2, partial correlations, …) and give meaning to what these exactly mean for our use case. Additionally, some estimated effects and prediction intervals will help us to determine the extent of the gap in the presence of a gender effect.\\n\\n6. Reporting format We consolidate results and findings in a slide presentation. Results of the statistical analyses are provided in a technical appendix document that reports on the requirements specified in the analysis protocol.\\n\\nOur Pay Equity Project Phases\\n\\nDesigning the Pay Equity Methodology\\n\\nDevelop preliminary pay equity\\n\\n\\n\\nanalysis methodology Create and present a preliminary report with the defined pay equity analysis methodology\\n\\nDefining the Pay Equity Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\nReview existing pay equity methodology Conduct Pay Gap Approach workshop\\n\\n• Hold data availability interviews\\n\\nFinalizing the Pay Equity Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresent the methodology for Management Board validation Fine-tune the methodology based on Management Board feedback Finalize pay equity report for defined population and present findings/insights\\n\\nAnalyzing Pay Equity Data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssess data quality and availability and clean the dataset Run statistical analyses to check for differences\\n\\nTraining & Handover\\n\\nHold training to handover methodology process to client\\n\\nFair Pay What is the Gender Pay Gap?\\n\\nThe Gender Pay Gap is the deviation in wages between males and females. Pay gaps are driven by a variety of characteristics, mainly including demographic differences. After accounting for reasonable differences, any remaining wage gap is considered the Adjusted Pay Gap, which is driven by gender or other variables not considered in the statistical model.\\n\\nUnadjusted Gender Pay Gap\\n\\nExpected Pay Gap\\n\\nAdjusted Pay Gap\\n\\nThe difference between the average (or median) wage of men vs. Average (or median) wage of women (in %). The average (or median) wage is calculated per gender. Then, the female deviation from the male average (median) wage is calculated per Grade to determine the % gap. Gap = (F-M) / M\\n\\nWhen the effect of all various demographic characteristics except gender, such as education, and work percentage are considered in explaining variation in wages, we use statistical equitation to calculate what expected pay gaps are within each Grade, given one’s demographic characteristics.\\n\\nage,\\n\\nseniority,\\n\\nAfter removing the effects of all the various demographic characteristics (done in the Expected Pay Gap step), we can calculate the difference between the Unadjusted Pay Gap and the Expected Pay Gap to test whether a significant gap (i.e. greater than 2,5%) remains. The remaining gap is attributed to the effect of gender and factors not defined in the statistical model.\\n\\nAdjusted Pay Gap = Unadjusted – Expected\\n\\nFair Pay 3 Dimensions of Fair Pay\\n\\nEqual Pay for Equal Work Risk for Within-occupation-establishment wage discrimination\\n\\nVertical UPG/APG per Unit\\n\\nRecruitment\\n\\n➢ Who gets hired\\n\\nMobility\\n\\n➢ Promotion ➢ Transfer ➢ Demotion\\n\\nn o i t a t n e m g e S l\\n\\nn o i t a n m\\n\\ni\\n\\ni r c s i d e v i t a c o\\n\\nD N A B\\n\\n5 B\\n\\n4 B\\n\\n3 B\\n\\nEqual work\\n\\nDismissal\\n\\na c i t r e V\\n\\nl l\\n\\na r o f k s i R\\n\\n2 B\\n\\n1 B\\n\\nHorizontal UPG/APG per Grade\\n\\nUnit 1 Unit 2 Unit 3 Unit 4 Unit 5 Unit 6 Unit 7 Business Unit\\n\\nHorizontal Segmentation Risk for valuative discrimination\\n\\nUPG = Unadjusted Pay Gap APG = Adjusted Pay Gap\\n\\nJustified factors in wage variation:\\n\\nSeniority • Education • Performance (if unbiased) • … Fair Pay KPIs\\n\\n1.

They have no seat, and the table is locked inside a conference room to which they have no key. HR people are, for most practical purposes, neither strategic nor leaders.\\n\\nHR people aren’t the sharpest tacks in the box. We’ll be blunt: If you are an ambitious young thing newly graduated from a top college or B-school with your eye on a rewarding career in business, your first instinct is not to join the human-resources dance. • HR pursues efficiency in lieu of value. Why? Because it’s easier — and easier to measure. • HR isn’t working for you.

The company specialises in immunology and aims to improve the quality of life of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases and cancer. The argenx Immunology Innovation Program (IIP) combines the knowledge of its own employees with that of leading academic researchers and scientists, resulting in the development of a portfolio of new drugs based on antibodies that is one of the absolute world leaders. Today, the BEL20 company has a market value of around €15 billion and argenx has some 1,000 employees, spread across offices in Ghent, Boston, Tokyo and Geneva.\n",

      "CEO of Ekopak\n",
      "Alumnus of SME Challenge (2013)\n",
      "Ekopak was founded in 2004. In 2013, Pieter Loose took over as CEO and started developing a ‘Water-as-a-Service’ model for sustainable water management as the basis for a sustainable future. By doing so, the company is meeting the enormous challenge of continuing to provide our water-driven economy with suitable water on the one hand and ensuring that the population’s basic right to sufficient drinking water remains guaranteed on the other. Ekopak has become the champion in water recycling and sustainable water use, helping the industry to build a sustainable future with respect for people, the environment and society.\n",
      "Five years after winning the title of Promising Company in West Flanders, Pieter undertook a successful IPO at Euronext Brussels in 2021. In the process, the company raised 56 million euros in capital to achieve sustainable growth. The technology is now available in 12 countries and Ekopak has opened offices in France. Over the past year, the number of employees has tripled and the company currently has around 80 employees. The annual turnover is €11,300,000. This year, the company is once again aiming for substantial growth.\n",

      "The Vlerick Award is presented annually by Vlerick Business School as a tribute to successful Vlerick alumni who, as entrepreneurs and business leaders, are at the helm of fast-growing organisations. The 2022 Vlerick Enterprising Leader Award went to Tim Van Hauwermeiren. After successfully completing his Executive MBA at Vlerick 15 years ago, he went on to co-found argenx, now a BEL-20 company with a market cap of around 17 billion euros. During the award show, Dean Marion Debruyne sat down with him for a talk about entrepreneurship and the role that Vlerick played in his journey.\n",
      "Entrepreneurship is a team sport\n",
      "Dean Marion Debruyne interviews Vlerick Award winner Tim Van Hauwermeiren (argenx) on his entrepreneurial journey. He talks about the collaborative spirit, about optionality and embracing failure and how a business school education equipped him with the knowledge, the skills and the confidence to take the leap.\n",
      "It has been a remarkable year with the successful FDA approval of the new drug Vyvgart. That also means that Argenx is transforming from an R&D company into a commercial company as well. What does that do for the organisation?\n",
      "Tim Van Hauwermeiren: “It was a key question we had as co-founders, and I think they will remember that management meeting back in 2017 when we saw the idea to go to market ourselves instead of just handing over the keys of the car to big pharma, which is the traditional model. And one of the concerns was that we would lose the spirit and DNA of the company as we are a science-based, data-based R&D company. We came out of that meeting realising that in our playing field of rare diseases, it's not a numbers game. What is important is the quality of the touchpoints you have with the physicians and the patients. So, we thought we could be successful through marketing from the science and selling from the data. And to my delight that is exactly what is happening. We have an equal number of scientists and medical people in the field as we have sales reps. And when they call on the physicians and they talk about the science, and the biology, and the data of the company, that is actually driving the launch and the sales of the product. I think that is an important revelation. A second thing that is happening is that we now have patients who are addressing the scientists in the company, and that is such a powerful dynamic.”\n",
      "Suddenly the patient is very real.\n",
      "“A chairwoman of the MGFA Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) addressed all the scientists through a video message. And she spoke about her life, what she suffered as an MG patient, and the poor medication she was on today. And you could hear a pin drop on the floor. At the end of her message, she urged the scientists to hurry because she did not want young women being diagnosed with myasthenia gravis today to have to undergo the same fate as she did. And the power of a patient talking to the scientists is incredible.”\n",
      "You mentioned the spirit of the company. The name argenx is linked to the story of the Argonauts. You believe entrepreneurship is not about the individual, but about the team. You co-founded argenx with Hans de Haard and Torsten Dreier. Can you tell us a little bit about that collaborative spirit, that idea of entrepreneurship as a team sport, and how you implement that in the culture of argenx?\n",
      "“I think it's pretty lonely if you're a single person trying to create something from scratch by being an entrepreneur. I do not believe in the myth of the individual entrepreneur in the garage. Maybe it existed one day in the past, but it certainly does not exist today. In the complex and fast-moving world, there's nothing that can beat a complementary team standing shoulder to shoulder. I personally had the courage to jump because I had two co-founders who were jumping with me. We had been working together for about six years. We knew we could be successful together. And we knew how we would react in tough times. The investment community invests in people too. Because in the beginning there's just a business plan with hardly any data or evidence it can work. So, in our case, I think they really invested in the team of founders.\n",
      "The theme of this edition of the Vlerick Award is fear, fake, and failure. There also must have been failures along the way. You talk about optionality. What exactly does that mean and how do you implement that?\n",
      "“Whatever scenario play you do, half of your business plan is just not going to work. Therefore, it’s important that you create options, so you're not tied to one solution, one product, or one service. It gives you optionality. And then depending on what the market tells you or the data tell you, you can invest in the winning option and forget about the other options. It’s a very dangerous situation if your company ends up in a binary situation with only one option left. Then it’s make or break, and I think that's really scary. Having an option portfolio is your best insurance policy against uncertainty. And dealing with failure is part of life in an R&D company. A piece of advice to the audience is to adopt the mindset of the scientist, who is doing an experiment that will yield data. There are no good or bad data, but there will be data points you can navigate by. I would be lying if I would say that it’s not emotionally tough when your experiment fails. From the outside, it all looks like it was all planned, pre-programmed and only successful. On the inside, you see as many failures as you see successes.\n",
      "You also talked about how you knew each other before you started the company. When you were an MBA student at Vlerick, I think you still worked for Ablynx. How does corporate life compare to entrepreneurial life? What is for you the main distinction?\n",
      "“When I look back at my own career, I realise now that I have always tried to live close to entrepreneurs. As a student, I was very close to Professor Verstraete, who was actually an entrepreneur, disguised as a professor. When working at P&G, I was very close to a person who was an intrapreneur, creating businesses all the time. And ultimately, I joined Ablynx to witness an entrepreneur from as close as I could, and to learn by observing and participating. The big benefit of big corporations is they have time to invest in people. When I look back at my management training at P&G, it would be difficult to do the job I'm doing today without any of that management training. It goes back to the business school too. No matter how entrepreneurial you are, in today's world, you need to be equipped with certain skills and knowledge to be able to do the job. It gives you the confidence, it equips you to then make the jump, and do what you wanted to do.”\n",
      "I love to hear you talk about management training like that, choosing a business school over the school of life. So, I would love to hear what impact Vlerick had on you.\n",
      "“It gives you the courage. Companies are very good at making you feel very busy, and you're running from one thing to the next, not having enough time to think. For me, a business school had two big benefits. You had to decouple from the business and spend several hours thinking about totally different stuff. And then the ideas come, and you start to scribble them down. So not only are you being equipped, but you also have time to think. And by the time I came out of business school, I had my toolkit ready to go, but I think the idea was also maturing.”\n",
      "Well, I do hope that you don't need a lot of optionality in the future of argenx. We do wish you loads of success for the future development of the company and, once more, congratulations on winning the Vlerick award.\n",

      "The Vlerick Enterprising Leader Award is a Vlerick Business School initiative recognising the achievements of alumni that have gone on to become business leaders boasting excellent track records in both leadership and entrepreneurship, whose organisations have also gone on to have a positive social impact. Their businesses have grown, in a sustainable way, into substantial players at the top of their respective sectors.\n",
      "Felix Van de Maele, CEO of Collibra: ‘I am truly honoured to have won this award. I see it as a reflection of what we have already achieved with Collibra. I believe that a continual desire to learn is a key factors behind entrepreneurial success. My time at Vlerick was not only the perfect preparation for starting Collibra, it also taught me the growth mindset that I apply to this day.’ \n",
      "The Vlerick Venture Award is given to young, entrepreneurial Vlerick alumni who, as owners or founders of rapidly growing businesses, have had a positive societal impact.\n",
      "Maarten Michielssens, CEO of EnergyVision: ‘When I started at Vlerick in 2005, I was a German-speaker who had never had any lessons in economics or statistics, knew nothing about Excel and did not know how companies work. During my time at Vlerick, I expanded my knowledge, made friends and acquaintances, boosted my self-confidence and, when I graduated, I felt sure that I would become an entrepreneur sooner rather than later. Without Vlerick, EnergyVision would never have seen the light of day. It feels amazing to receive this award from the school that taught me everything.’\n",
      "Marion Debruyne, Vlerick Business School Dean: ‘The Vlerick Award nominees are all fantastic role models for our students, due to their level of entrepreneurship and leadership. They also illustrate what impact the school's alumni can have. On behalf of the professors and staff at Vlerick, I would like to congratulate them on the path they have taken. I am already looking forward to the next chapter.’\n",
      "Hilde Crevits, Flemish Minister for Work, Economy and Innovation: ‘The Vlerick Award has once again shown that our Flemish entrepreneurs are world leaders, and that daring to do business really pays off! Some nominees have grown all the way from small start-ups to unicorns, listed companies and major employers in less than a decade. We can therefore be more than proud of this evening’s nominees and winners, along with all the entrepreneurs sticking their necks out in continuing to put Flanders on the map. Entrepreneurs provide a level of creativity, employment and prosperity for our economy as a whole. For this, I am eternally grateful, and I will continue to support them in every way I can!’\n",

The company completed its second acquisition earlier this year of American data quality vendor OwlDQ and was recently named to the prestigious for the Forbes Cloud 100 list for the fifth consecutive year. \n",
      "About Maarten Michielssens\n",
      "Founder and CEO of EnergyVision\n",
      "Alumnus Masters in General Management (2006)\n",
      "EnergyVision started in 2014 in Ghent – with 4 employees and 6,200 EUR equity – but today EnergyVision has 135 employees, offices in Belgium, Morocco and China and a group turnover of 140 million EUR in 2021.\n",
      "EnergyVision designs, builds, finances and operates energy projects.\n",
      "Since 2014, they have implemented more than 8,000 energy projects. From large (12,000 solar panels) to small (6 solar panels). From multinationals to farmers. This year, they turned the football stadiums of RSC Anderlecht, RWD Molenbeek and KAA Gent into sustainable stadiums, but they also equipped the houses of more than 2,000 Brussels families with solar panels.\n",
      "Last month, EnergyVision unveiled its future plans during a roundtable discussion in the presence of several Ministers from the Federal and regional governments of Belgium. With \"Vision 2030\", the aim is to build over 2,700 MW of solar panels in their three core countries (Belgium, Morocco, China) between now and 2030. That is the equivalent of all the nuclear power plants combined at Doel, Belgium. Through this programme, they are building a better world, step by step.\n",
