       "\"Source: Management Team (07/11/2022); Author: Smaranda Boros\\nOn the one hand, we see that in times of crisis or prolonged anxiety (which is the overarching emotional colouring of uncertainty), we find authoritarian leaders more attractive. What is it though about their discourse that is so appealing?\\nThe what: One thing that is deeply reassuring in periods of extended uncertainty is our belonging to something ‘bigger than ourselves’; we find comfort in the expression of unambiguous ‘black-and-white’ opinions that reassert our cultural identity and worldview. This is where discourses that capitalise on our social identities in non-ambiguous terms, and which reassert the positivity of our identities, are very appealing.\\nThe how: The other reassuring aspect belongs to how the message is packaged, namely offering certainty – of any kind. In his research of tweets following a ‘local’ catastrophe (e.g., the bombing in the Manchester Arena), Almog Simchon found that words expressing certainty – like must, absolute, imperative etc. peaked in the tweets of people from that community, whatever the topic they were discussing. When the world is tearing at the seams, we need reassurance, we need to draw back to something safe – and a discourse that uses words expressing certainty does just that.\\nOn the other hand, research has shown beyond doubt that in terms of economic downturn or crisis we see a higher occurrence of appointments of women in leadership positions. This is called ‘the glass cliff’ (for those curious to learn more, check out Michelle Ryan’s work on this topic) – and aptly so, because most women will end up falling off it. One of the explanations the authors propose here is truly as simple as the archetype of women as carers, which becomes attractive when we feel under threat.\\nNow, so far we seem to be in a catch-22 of leadership in crisis. What are the options: to be an authoritarian leader who promotes polarised thinking or to be a mother figure? In fact, we need to go deeper and analyse the traits that make these two archetypal figures attractive in a crisis – and then mould our communication accordingly.\\nFirst, research shows that we often mistake certainty for clarity. While yes, certainty is reassuring, you can obtain the same effect through clear, non-ambiguous communication. This does not mean taking rigid positions; it simply means being very clear and direct on how things are, what we know and what we do not know, what we do to steer the ship through the storm. In crisis we need frequent, clear, transparent communication from our leaders.\\nSecond, we still need the boost of belonging to something greater than ourselves (and religions throughout the world and history have understood this for thousands of years). But this something greater does not need to polarize us. Discourses that connect us to future generations, discourses that capitalise how humanity has come together in times of crisis and managed to achieve impossible feats, discourses that make us aware of the larger ecosystem we are part of – they all offer that belonging without the tribalism of polarisation.\\nThird – what we want from our leaders is compassion. Yes, we want empathy, we all want to be seen and heard and recognized, but in dire times we want more than that. Empathy is the capacity to put yourself in someone else’s shoes and understand their affective experience. Compassion is action that you take from a place of empathy. So, in such times, we want actions, not words. Action that is compassionate towards our difficulties, action that doesn’t just follow profits, but which is also humane. Compassion is expressed both in actions and in words – how we frame and explain our actions, opening bridges and dialogue.\\nOne last but crucial thing. You cannot do all those things – sit with the uncomfortable truths and name them, lift people to higher moral ground, and acting with compassion, if you yourself are not in a very grounded place. Showing compassion to yourself as a leader, being clear in your ideals but also in your boundaries, and constantly coming back to what you believe in – all these elements ground you and lead to grit – your capacity to build resilience through hard times.\\nI love the metaphor of a beating heart: in order to function optimally, a heart needs to take as much as it gives. Making sure you are in a good place, and taking time to rebalance yourself is not selfishness. It is the first step to becoming that point of equilibrium that brings balance in a world gone wild.\\n\\nWhat constitutes good data quality?

Completeness also describes the general availability of content that the user needs to be able to perform his work at all. (...)\\n\\nAccuracy\\n\\nDepending on the context, the data is available with the required accuracy (e.g. number of decimal places).\\n\\nUp-to-dateness timeliness time reference\\n\\nCompanies aim to have committed employees, and rightly so. A satisfied employee is one thing, but a truly committed employee is quite another. The latter is also willing and motivated to go the extra mile, help shape changes, attend additional training courses etc. HR departments are therefore focusing fully on this commitment, pulling out all the stops. “We see a lot of great initiatives and good intentions”, explains Kristien Van Bruystegem, who conducts research at Vlerick Business School on the factors that make a company a great place to work. “However, many companies skip one step. According to the Great Place to Work philosophy, trust is the absolute basic condition to forge commitment. Trust in the management team results in greater commitment, which, in turn, leads to higher productivity levels and lower absenteeism rates”, she continues.\\nKeep refilling the reservoir\\nCommitment tends to fluctuate – a slight decrease can be followed by an increase and vice-versa. Trust, on the other hand, must be constantly nurtured by the company, Kristien explains. “Every organisation has what we can define as a ‘trust reservoir’, which sometimes leaks. You need to try to patch up all the leaks and refill the reservoir. At the moment, few companies are aware of the importance of trust. You can launch a hundred projects focusing on employee satisfaction, but if there is no trust, they will fade into oblivion”.\\nKristien illustrates this with a concrete example. “Involvement also plays an important role in commitment. That’s why some companies have launched a platform where their employees can share their opinion. The problem is that if there is a lack of trust, few people will use this platform. Another issue is that when the company receives messages from its employees, it needs to do something with them and communicate about them. Needless to say, there is no need for total democracy. Employees do not necessarily want to have a say in policymaking, but they do want a say in matters that have a direct impact on their job. If companies fail to properly deal with feedback or if they head in the opposite direction, they lose their employees’ trust.”\\nA tree with many branches\\nIf there is a climate of trust, people will not only adopt a more open approach, they will also complete tasks without asking too many questions. They will assume that their colleagues or managers would never ask them to do anything unnecessary. “At such companies, it is less common to put people in cc when sending e-mails”, Kristien adds.\\nOn the other hand, when there is little or no trust, the entire corporate structure is affected. Kristien compares this to a disease ravaging a person’s entire body. “If a new employee hears all sorts of negative stories from day one, he is not given the time and space to form his own positive opinion. Likewise, not taking heed of frustrations that may initially seem quite insignificant can cause them to escalate into far more serious problems.”\\nIn a nutshell, trust is beneficial to the company’s entire immune system, protecting it even when the going gets tough from an economic point of view. Companies that deal with redundancies in an open, respectful and credible manner can also have a positive effect on the remaining staff, and by extension even on those required to step down. The latter then continue to be positive ambassadors for the organisation.\\nWhat is a climate of trust and, perhaps more importantly, how can it be achieved?\\nTrust is a somewhat abstract concept that is difficult to define. However, a step-by-step approach can give it a more concrete meaning.\\nFirst and foremost, it is important for a company to launch several initiatives, such as mentors for new employees or a clear and transparent training policy.\\nSecondly, these practices need to be supported at all levels in the organisation and they must be implemented in the same way across all departments. “Everything must be streamlined. The same values should apply to all contacts and activities. Words and deeds must be consistent. All of this should be implemented at all levels, starting from the management. This credibility is essential to create a climate of trust. After all, you can’t expect your staff to promote certain values if the CEO fails to do so”, Kristien says.\\nAnd thirdly, the methods used are also important. “It ain’t what you do, it’s the way that you do it”, said a famous jazz song from the late 1930s. In this case, the managers are the lead singers. Kristien believes they can really make the difference. All managers should be aware of the impact their behaviour has on the employees. Open feedback is very important in this view. Moreover, many companies are putting people management and expertise on the same level. That being said, people managers must enjoy the necessary support within the company so as to better fulfil their tasks.\\nKristien also says managers should get to know their team members very well. “Not everyone likes to be praised in front of a large audience. For some people, this turns a positive event into a stressful experience. And of course, that is not the way to earn their trust. Nevertheless, prizes and rewards should not take centre stage. A personal approach, time and patience are far more important. If the manager is playing with his smartphone during a meeting or assessment instead of listening attentively, the employee gets the feeling he is not important.” However, Kristien stresses that this goes both ways. A manager should put trust in his employees, but these employees must also be worthy of the trust they are given. It should be a mutual gift. After all, if you receive more than you were expecting, you tend to give more back.\\nThere is no such thing as a ready-made solution. Some things may work well in one company, but fail when replicated in another. The main aim is to create a corporate culture where trust is key. There are various ways to put this into practice, but according to Kristien, there is one common denominator, “repeat, repeat, repeat, because building trust is a long-term project. Some initiatives may be rather unsuccessful at first, but with some time and effort they can turn into success. An example: if no one shows up at an informal breakfast session with the CEO, that shouldn’t keep you from organising a second session.”\\nTips & tricks\\nGet to know your team. As a manager, you should know your people through and through. Only then can you create a long-term relationship of trust.\\nEnsure your staff feel good. Tell them good morning, sincerely ask how they are feeling or pay them a compliment. Pay attention to them during meetings and let go of your computer or smartphone for a minute while you are dealing with them.\\nTeam meetings are a good way to work on trust too. Ensure scheduled meetings actually do take place, make enough time for meetings and don’t postpone them. Ask everyone to send their agenda in advance and let several people take turns in organising or chairing meetings. That boosts their personal development and creates better group dynamics.\\nEnsure an efficient communication flow. Don’t forget to communicate, explain your decisions and sell your message well, otherwise it may seem as if nothing is happening.\\nInvolve the team in the awarding of employees who have been in service for a given number of years. Join forces to come up with a personal gift rather than the usual bottle of champagne.\\nTreat people as they want to be treated, which is not necessarily the way you want to be treated.\\nPut words into actions. Make fewer promises, but do keep all of them. When asking people for their opinion, take it into account or at least explain why something cannot be done.\\nIf the atmosphere at the company or in the team has taken a hit, there are usually other underlying issues, such as a heavy workload, job insecurity etc. Don’t try to solve these problems simply with a party or a little extra. Your intentions may be good, but people cannot be bought over. Moreover, in those cases, the core of the problem persists.\\nShow respect and treat all people as equals. If you allow one person to sit back and relax all day, you will lose the others’ trust.\\nWhen sending out e-mails, only put people in cc if it is really necessary. Trying to cover your back does not inspire trust.\\nTreat your staff as if they were working on a voluntary basis, even if this is not the case.\\nWant to read more?
